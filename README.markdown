# TCStackNotifierPlugin - TeamCity -> Stack Notifications

Sorry, couldn't resist attempting this:

OMG! Allow notifications in TeamCity to post to Stack channel with a webhook.

Issues : it's conifgured as a user notification on TC , but posts to all on Stack. Dont think you can do 'server' notifications.

Pretty plain output at the moment, but we can build it up over time.
